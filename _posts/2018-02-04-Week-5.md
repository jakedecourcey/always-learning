# Week 5: Jan 29 - Feb 4

## Goal Progress

##### Job Ready JavaScript
Alright, done with CS50! 

##### Typing
Still cruising. I think I'm going to stick with it, though. I'm typing correctly without thinking about it occasianally.

##### Reading
I spent most of my time powering through CS50 instead of reading, but I'm still on pace.

##### Spanish
I'm going much faster in Spanish this week. I seem to have hit a breakpoint where I'm learning new things, which is motivating.

## Noteworthy Notes
I learned a ton, and I'm glad to have picked up all the foundational stuff that I did, but I'm really ready to be moving on. I feel much more confident moving on to bigger and better things. No regrets, though. I was floundering a little trying to move forward, and this guide is just what I needed. CS50 is the perfect starting point.

## Looking Ahead
I'll likely finish the next course in Job-Ready JavaScript this week. It's *Learn to Code HTML & CSS* which is pretty elementary. I'm not being cocky when I say that I've completed nearly half of it and haven't learned a thing. Which is good.

I'd like to finish *Coming Apart* this week, too.
