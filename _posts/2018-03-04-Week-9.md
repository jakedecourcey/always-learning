# Week 9: Feb 26 - Mar 4

 

## Goal Progress

 

##### Job Ready JavaScript

I did not do anything this week for this class, but that's what I expected with vacation. There wasn't much time conducive to focused work. 

 

##### Typing

Typing is on track.
 
 

##### Reading

Vacation was great for reading, though. I read 2.5 books in 5 days. 

 

##### Spanish

Still on track for Spanish.

 

## Noteworthy Notes

It's not part of the program, but I'm working through David Geddes' *Flexbox Zombies* to improve my CSS. I'm a little more than 1/2 done with that.

## Looking Ahead

Now that I'm back from vacation, I have one extra day off, which I'm using as a reset day to refocus and reprioritize my goals. I'd like to reduce my "getting nothing done" time a bit and concentrate more time on job-hunt activities.
