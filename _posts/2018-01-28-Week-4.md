# Week 4: Jan 22 - Jan 28
## Goal Progress
##### Job Ready JavaScript
Problem set 7 of CS50 is huge and long, so I'm still working on it. It's enjoyable, though, because it's a web app, which means that it feels more related to my end game. 

##### Typing
Good progress this week. I've completed through lesson 101. I'm working on speed now in the lessons. 

##### Reading
*Coming Apart* is excellent, but dense. I'm trying to take it at a pace that I can digest instead of going for max speed.

##### Spanish
According to Duolingo, I'm now 29% fluent in Spanish. Whatever that means.

## Noteworthy Notes
I'm getting weary of CS50. I like it, but the projects are wearing me down a little. I'm ready to move on. Hopefully soon.

In typing, interestingly, I've gotten much worse at typing my old way now, too. I'm sort of in between styles now and I'm not good at either. It reminds me of when I switched how I tie my shoes. For almost a month I had to make multiple tries at tying my shoes almost every day. That was annoying.

## Looking Ahead
I've got some days off this week, so I'd like to make strong progress all the way around. I also intend to play a bunch of Pillars of Eternity. BUT, mostly working. I'm not sure how much time the last problem set of CS50 takes, but if it's short, I might finish this week. That would be awesome.
