# Week 8: Feb 19- Feb 25

 

## Goal Progress

 

##### Job Ready JavaScript

I’m over halfway done with *Programming for the Web with JavaScript*
and am now beginning to mess with React.

 

##### Typing

My speed sits at around 40 WPM, adjusted for accuracy. I’ll
continue to practice until I hit 60 at least. 

 

##### Reading

I’ve finished *Coming Apart*, *Economics in One Lesson*, and
*Gardens of the Moon*, although the last was audio. 

 

##### Spanish

Still on track for Spanish.

 

## Noteworthy Notes

I need to decide how to count audio books. I listen to over
500 hours of audio books and podcasts per year, but it’s not the same as
actually reading books. I’ll keep track of the audio books, at least, but I won’t
count them towards the goal list. They’re basically all novels, anyway.

## Looking Ahead

I’m going on vacation this week, but it’s not the *get a lot
done* type of vacation. We’ll see what happens.
