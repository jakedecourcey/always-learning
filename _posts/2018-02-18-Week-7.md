# Week 7: Feb 12- Feb 18

## Goal Progress

##### Job Ready JavaScript
Change of plans - I've finished 1.5 out of 4 weeks of *Programming for the Web with JavaScript* instead of reading. See below for the rationale.

##### Typing
Solid progress this week. I'm typing correctly most of the time now, so I'm now focused on speed and accuracy.

##### Reading
The 3 books at a time strategy is, surprisingly, not great for speed. I'm so close to finishing *Coming Apart,* though. I may even finish it tonight.

##### Spanish
Still on track for Spanish.

## Noteworthy Notes
So, a change of plans this week. I realized that I was reading *YDKJS* but not understanding it. It's covering things that I've never encountered before, so I'm struggling to find mental anchors to remember anything. I decided to take the *Programming for the Web with JavaScript* class first and get some JS under my belt before I return to reading.

## Looking Ahead
Depending on how challenging the homework is, I'd like to finish this class in less than 2 weeks, so here we go.
