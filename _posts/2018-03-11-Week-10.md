# Week 10: Mar 4 - Mar 11

 

## Goal Progress

 

##### Job Ready JavaScript

I finished Flexbox Zombies, which isn't technically part of the course, but is a recommended supplement.  


##### Typing

Typing is on track. I've slowed down on the exercises since I'm proficiently touch-typing for daily use, but I'd like to continue for speed.
 

##### Reading

I haven't read a ton since vacation, but I'm about to start *Getting Things Done*, by David Allen. Hopefully I'll turn into a magical productivity machine.


##### Spanish

I haven't done much Spanish lately, but I got a chance to use what I've learned and it went pretty well, so that's encouraged me to do more.
 

## Noteworthy Notes

So, more changes in plans. I really just hate the PennX course, so I'm making a change. I'm working through Colt Steele's *Web Developer Boot Camp* instead. It's a good deal more material, and it includes a lot more than the PennX course. I'll finish the JavaScript sections and use the rest as supplemental material for future reference.

## Looking Ahead

My wife is out of town this week, so in theory I should be extra productive. I intend to get a good start on the JS portion of Colt Steele's Boot Camp this week in addition to CSS Zen Garden.
