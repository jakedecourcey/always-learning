# Week 6: Feb 5 - Feb 11

## Goal Progress

##### Job Ready JavaScript
AS I suspected, I was able to wrap up *Learn to Code HTML & CSS* quickly. I also completed my first mock site, [located here.](https://github.com/jakedecourcey/Practice-Site-1)

##### Typing
Not great progress this week, but I've been typing properly in general much more often, which is huge for me.

##### Reading
I'm now working on 3 books in addition to all my daily news and podcasts, so that's probably not wise. I've now also started Steven Erikson's *Gardens of the Moon.*

##### Spanish
Decent progress in Spanish this week. Just on track. 

## Noteworthy Notes
I learned a ton, and I'm glad to have picked up all the foundational stuff that I did, but I'm really ready to be moving on. I feel much more confident moving on to bigger and better things. No regrets, though. I was floundering a little trying to move forward, and this guide is just what I needed. CS50 is the perfect starting point.

## Looking Ahead
This week I'll definitely finish the next chapter in *You Don't Know JS* and the CSS Zen Garden assignment.

I really will finish either *Coming Apart* or *Economics in One Lesson.*
