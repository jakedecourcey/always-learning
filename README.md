# Always-Learning-2018

What I'm doing in 2018.

## Introduction

I graduated from Western Governor's University with a bachelor's degree in I.T. at the end of 2017. Now, the real work begins.

### Goals

* Get a job in web development
* Learn to touch type
* Read 26 books

### Implementation

#### Get a job in web development

Getting a degree was just the start. I'll be working through p1xt's [Get Job ready - JavaScript Edition - Version 2.0](https://github.com/jakedecourcey/p1xt-guides/blob/master/job-ready-javascript-edition-2.0.md). I've forked a copy of the guide to this repo to track my own progress. [Check it out here.](https://github.com/jakedecourcey/always-learning/blob/master/Job-Ready-JavaScript-2.md)

#### Learn to touch type

I'll be using [The Typing Club](typingclub.com) to improve my typing skills. By the end of the year, I want to be touch typing at 60 WPM. [See my progress here.](https://github.com/jakedecourcey/always-learning/blob/master/Typing-Club.md)

#### Read 26 Books

I'm using Tim Challie's [2018 Christian Reading Challenge](https://www.challies.com/resources/the-2018-christian-reading-challenge/). This is certainly the least technical of my educational goals, but choosing books that are mostly non-technical will keep me involved in a wide range of topics. [My progress is marked off here.](https://github.com/jakedecourcey/always-learning/blob/master/2018-Christian-Reading-Challenge.md)
